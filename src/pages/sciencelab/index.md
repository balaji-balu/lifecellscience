### Use of Vernier Callipers to
### (i) measure diameter of a small spherical/cylindrical body,
### (ii) measure the dimensions of a given regular body of known mass and hence to determine its density; and
### (iii) measure the internal diameter and depth of a given cylindrical object like beaker/glass/calorimeter and hence to calculate its volume.
