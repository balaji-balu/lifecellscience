###  Introduction of Physics
###  Physics and Mathematics
###  Units and Measurements
#### Performing a measurement means comparing an unknown physical (or chemical) quantity with a quantity of the same type taken as reference using an instrument.

A measurement necessarily involves a reference frame and therefore units. In the not so distant past, there were numerous units, which had little in common with each other. The first coherent system of units only appeared with the French revolution: the metric system. This system was internationally ratified by the Metre Convention on 20 May 1875, a diplomatic treaty which set up the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).

In 1960, during the eleventh Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM), the International System of Units, the SI, was developed. It now includes two classes of units :

Fundamental Physical Quantity 
Derived Physical Quantity 
We must not believe, however, that once set up, this system is fixed. Progress made in science and technology and the new requirements from society and therefore the needs in terms of increased accuracy, will led the LNE and all national metrology institutes to continuously improve the practical realisation of all SI units. And this concern involves the references as well as the means for transfer to the users, to allow matching at best these new needs. Definitions of units sometimes need to be changed and new definitions added.
The base units and their definitions
To date, the International System of Units, the SI, is made up of seven base units (between brackets the sole/single symbol representing it) :

The metre (m)
The kilogram (kg)
The second (s)
The ampere (A)
The kelvin (K)
The candela (cd)
The mole (mol)

### Electric Charges and Fields
#### Coulombs Law
The interaction between charged objects is a non-contact force that acts over some distance of separation. Charge, charge and distance. Every electrical interaction involves a force that highlights the importance of these three variables. Whether it is a plastic golf tube attracting paper bits, two like-charged balloons repelling or a charged Styrofoam plate interacting with electrons in a piece of aluminum, there is always two charges and a distance between them as the three critical variables that influence the strength of the interaction. In this section of Lesson 3, we will explore the importance of these three variables.

#### Basic Force
The electrical force, like all forces, is typically expressed using the unit Newton. Being a force, the strength of the electrical interaction is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the electrical force is dependent upon whether the charged objects are charged with like charge or opposite charge and upon their spatial orientation. By knowing the type of charge on the two objects, the direction of the force on either one of them can be determined with a little reasoning. In the diagram below, objects A and B have like charge causing them to repel each other. Thus, the force on object A is directed leftward (away from B) and the force on object B is directed rightward (away from A). On the other hand, objects C and D have opposite charge causing them to attract each other. Thus, the force on object C is directed rightward (toward object D) and the force on object D is directed leftward (toward object C). When it comes to the electrical force vector, perhaps the best way to determine the direction of it is to apply the fundamental rules of charge interaction (opposites attract and likes repel) using a little reasoning.
