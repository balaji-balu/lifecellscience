###  Introduction of Physics
###  Physics and Mathematics
###  Units and Measurements
#### Physics is about the study of energy and forces. In order to test and measure physical quantities we need to define some standard measures which we everyone can agree on. These standards can never perfectly accurate because they are rooted in the physical world but every endevour is made to make them as precise as possible. The internationally recognised authority for the definition of these standards is the Conference Generale des Poids et Measures (CGPM).
### Units
#### We must ensure that the result we use in our calculations are in the correct units. The consequence of getting it wrong can be very expensive as with the loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft in 1999. It spun out of control because part of the software assumed Imperial units and another part assumed metric units.

#### The units by which we now measure physical quantities is called the S.I. (System International) system established in 1960. Within this system, the most commonly used set of units in physics are M.K.S (Metres, Kilograms, Seconds) system

#### Collision
*The Strong physical interaction among bodies involving exchange of momenta in small interval of time, is called a Collision.*
*In collision particles may or may not come in real physical contact.*

*In a collision, before and after the impact, interaction forces between the colliding particles, becoomes efficitively zero, while during impact, the interaction forces are very large. in a collision  the effect of external forces such as gravity or friction are not taken into account as due to small duration of collision, average impulsive force responsible for the collision is much larger than external force acting on the system.*
*Considter two objects of masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> with initial momenta P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>. The objects collide, get apart with final momenta P<su>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> respectively. when two objects collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting in small duration $\delta$t cause a change in their respective momenta.*
#### F<sub>12</sub> $\delta$t = P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>1</sub>
#### F<sub>12</sub> $\delta$t = P<sub>2</sub> - P<sub>2</sub>
#### *According to Newton's third law,*
#### $\vec{F}$<sub>12</sub> = - $\vec{F]$<usb>21</sub>
#### *Therefore the total impulse on the first object is equal and opposite to that of second object*
#### $vec{$\delta$P}$<sub>1</sub> = - $vec{$\delta$P}$<sub>2</sub>

### Electric Charges and Fields
#### Coulombs Law
*The interaction between charged objects is a non-contact force that acts over some distance of separation. Charge, charge and distance. Every electrical interaction involves a force that highlights the importance of these three variables. Whether it is a plastic golf tube attracting paper bits, two like-charged balloons repelling or a charged Styrofoam plate interacting with electrons in a piece of aluminum, there is always two charges and a distance between them as the three critical variables that influence the strength of the interaction. In this section of Lesson 3, we will explore the importance of these three variables.*

#### Basic Force
The electrical force, like all forces, is typically expressed using the unit Newton. Being a force, the strength of the electrical interaction is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the electrical force is dependent upon whether the charged objects are charged with like charge or opposite charge and upon their spatial orientation. By knowing the type of charge on the two objects, the direction of the force on either one of them can be determined with a little reasoning. In the diagram below, objects A and B have like charge causing them to repel each other. Thus, the force on object A is directed leftward (away from B) and the force on object B is directed rightward (away from A). On the other hand, objects C and D have opposite charge causing them to attract each other. Thus, the force on object C is directed rightward (toward object D) and the force on object D is directed leftward (toward object C). When it comes to the electrical force vector, perhaps the best way to determine the direction of it is to apply the fundamental rules of charge interaction (opposites attract and likes repel) using a little reasoning.

### Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance.
### Current Electricity.
#### <span style="color:red"> Ohm's Law </span>
*We have studies that when a potential difference is applied between the ends of a conductors, current begins to flow through it. George Simon Ohm, a German physicist performed a series of experiments to determine the exact relationship between the potential difference and the electric current. On the basis of these experiments, he formulated a law which is called Ohm's Law and can be stated as, the potential difference(V) applied between the ends of a conductor bears a constant ratio with the electric current(I) flowing through it, provided the physical state of the conductor remains the same. the factors which constitute physical state of conductor are its lenght, area of cross section, temperature and material.* 

According to Ohm's Law 
#### *V $$\alpha$$ I*
i.e., V = (Constant) I
#### *$\frac{V}{I}$ = Constant*
#### *The constant in the above relation is called resistance (R) of the conductor*
#### *∴  $\frac{V}{I}$ = R*
#### *V = IR*
#### *If the potential difference is measured in volts and current in amperes, the resistance of conductor is said to be in ohms.*
#### *$\frac{Volt}{Ampere}$ = Ohm*
#### *The resistance of a conductor is said to be 1 ohm if the potential difference of 1 volt causes a current of 1 ampere to pass through the conductor.*
#### <span style="color:red"> *$\frac{1Volt}{1Ampere}$ = 1Ohm* </span>

#### Kirchoff's Law
##### *Omh's Law gives current- voltage relation in simple electrical circuits. But when the circuit is complicated, it will be difficult to find current distribution by Omh's law.*
##### *Kirchoff in 1842 formulated the following two laws which enable us to find the distribution of current in complicatied electrical circuits or electrical networks.*
##### *There are two types of Kirchoff's law.* 
##### *1. Kirchoff's Current Law or Kirchoff's Junction Law*
##### *2. Kirchoff's Voltage Law or Kirchoff's Loop Law*

#### Kirchoff's current Law or Junction Law
##### *At any junction, the sum of the currents entering the junction is equal to the sum of currents leave the junction.*
![Figure](/img/KCL.png)

##### *Sum of Input Current = Sum of Output Current*
##### *I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> = I<sub>4</sub> + I<sub>5</sub>*
##### *If we take currents approaching point of Junction in figure as positive and that leaving the point as negative then the above relation may be written as*  
##### *I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub> - I<sub>4</sub> - I<sub>5</sub> = 0*
##### *Hence the first law may be stated in other words that "The algebraic sum of currents at a junction is zero". Kirchoffs first law tells us that there is no accumulation of charge at any point if steady current flows in it. the net charge coming towards the point should be equalto that going away from it in the same time*
##### $$\Sigma$$I= 0
**Key Point*** : *Kirchoff's first law is accordance with law of Conservation of charge, since no charge can accumulate at a junction*

#### Kirchoff's Voltage Law or Loop Law
#### Wheatstone Bridge
*A resistance can be measured by Ohm’s law using a voltmeter and an ammeter in an electrical circuit. But this measurement is not accurate. To measure it more accurately Kristie devised and Wheatstone popularized a special network design called Wheatstone bridge. It is an arrangement of four resistances which can be used to measure one of them in terms of the rest.
The four resistors R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are connected as four sides of a quadrilateral ABCD as shown in figure.
A Galvanometer of resistance G is connected across one set of diagonally opposite corners B and D. A source of emf E with plug key K is connected across another set of diagonally opposite corners A and C.
When key K is closed current I is drawn from source. It splits as I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> at junction A and flows throught R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> resistors.
Current I<sub>2</sub> splits at junction B and flows as I<sub>G</sub> and I<sub>4</sub> through galvanometer and resistor R<sub>4</sub> respectively.
I<sub>G</sub> and I<sub>1</sub> Combine at junction D and flows as I<sub>3</sub> through the resistor R<sub>3</sub>.*

![Figure:1](/img/wheatstone-bridge.png)

#### Condision for balancing of bridge:
*A wheatstone bridge is said to be balanced when there is current through the galvanometer that is I<sub>G</sub> = 0. 
The Kirchoff's junction rule applied to junctions D and B. immediately to give us the relations I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> = I<sub>4</sub>. Next, we apply kirchoff's loop rules to closed loops ABDA and CBDC  and taking I<sub>G</sub> = 0.

*The first loop gives 
#### -I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>G</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> = 0
#### -I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> + 0 + I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> = 0 (I<sub>G</sub> = 0)
#### -I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> = 0
#### I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> 
#### I<sub>3</sub>R<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>4</sub>R<sub>2</sub> (we know that I<sub>1</sub>=I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> = I<sub>4</sub>)
#### $\frac{I_{3}}{I_{4}}$ = $\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}$ ----------------(1)

Similarly,
#### -I<sub>3</sub>R<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>G</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>R<sub>4</sub> = 0
#### -I<sub>3</sub>R<sub>3</sub> + 0 + I<sub>4</sub>R</sub>4 = 0 (I<sub>G</sub> = 0)
#### -I<sub>3</sub>R<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>4</sub>R<sub>4</sub> = 0
#### I<sub>3</sub>R<sub>3</sub> = I<sub>4</sub>R<sub>4</sub>
#### I<sub>1</sub>R<sub>3</sub> = I<sub>2</sub>R<sub>4</sub> (we know I<sub>1</sub>= I<sub>3</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>= I<sub>4</sub>)

#### *$\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}}$ = $\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}}$ ----------------(2)
#### from equation (1) and equation (2)
#### we have conclude that,
#### $\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}$ = $\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}}$

#### this is Wheatstone bridge balanced condition.
