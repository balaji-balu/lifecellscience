###  Introduction of Physics
###  Physics and Mathematics
###  Units and Measurements
#### Physics is about the study of energy and forces. In order to test and measure physical quantities we need to define some standard measures which we everyone can agree on. These standards can never perfectly accurate because they are rooted in the physical world but every endevour is made to make them as precise as possible. The internationally recognised authority for the definition of these standards is the Conference Generale des Poids et Measures (CGPM).
### Units
#### We must ensure that the result we use in our calculations are in the correct units. The consequence of getting it wrong can be very expensive as with the loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft in 1999. It spun out of control because part of the software assumed Imperial units and another part assumed metric units.

#### The units by which we now measure physical quantities is called the S.I. (System International) system established in 1960. Within this system, the most commonly used set of units in physics are M.K.S (Metres, Kilograms, Seconds) system

### Base Units
The basic units are shown in below Table.

### Electric Charges and Fields
#### Coulombs Law
The interaction between charged objects is a non-contact force that acts over some distance of separation. Charge, charge and distance. Every electrical interaction involves a force that highlights the importance of these three variables. Whether it is a plastic golf tube attracting paper bits, two like-charged balloons repelling or a charged Styrofoam plate interacting with electrons in a piece of aluminum, there is always two charges and a distance between them as the three critical variables that influence the strength of the interaction. In this section of Lesson 3, we will explore the importance of these three variables.

#### Basic Force
The electrical force, like all forces, is typically expressed using the unit Newton. Being a force, the strength of the electrical interaction is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the electrical force is dependent upon whether the charged objects are charged with like charge or opposite charge and upon their spatial orientation. By knowing the type of charge on the two objects, the direction of the force on either one of them can be determined with a little reasoning. In the diagram below, objects A and B have like charge causing them to repel each other. Thus, the force on object A is directed leftward (away from B) and the force on object B is directed rightward (away from A). On the other hand, objects C and D have opposite charge causing them to attract each other. Thus, the force on object C is directed rightward (toward object D) and the force on object D is directed leftward (toward object C). When it comes to the electrical force vector, perhaps the best way to determine the direction of it is to apply the fundamental rules of charge interaction (opposites attract and likes repel) using a little reasoning.

### Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance.
### Current Electricity.
#### Wheatstone Bridge
A resistance can be measured by Ohmâ€™s law using a voltmeter and an ammeter in an electrical circuit. But this measurement is not accurate. To measure it more accurately Kristie devised and Wheatstone popularized a special network design called Wheatstone bridge. It is an arrangement of four resistances which can be used to measure one of them in terms of the rest. 
The four resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4 are connected as four sides of a quadrilateral ABCD as shown in figure.
A Galvanometer of resistance G is connected across one set of diagonally opposite corners B and D. A source of emf E with plug key K is connected across another set of diagonally opposite corners A and C.
When key K is closed current I is drawn from source. It splits as I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> at junction A and flows throught R1 and R2 resistors.
Current I2 splits at junction B and flows as IG and I4 through galvanometer and resistor r4 respectively.
IG and I1 Combine at junction D and flows as I3 through the resistor R3.

#### Condision for balancing of bridge:
A wheatstone bridge is said to be balanced when there is current through the galvanometer that is IG = 0. 
The Krichoff's junction rule applied to junctions D and B. immediately to give us the relations I1 = I3 and I2 =I4. Next, we apply kirchoff's loop rules to closed loops ABDA and CBDC  and taking IG =0.
The first loop gives 
#### -I1R1 + IG + I2R2 = 0
#### -I1R1 + 0 + I2R2 = 0 (IG = 0)
#### -I1R1 + I2R2 = 0
#### I1R1 = I2R2 
#### I3R1 = I4R2 (I1=I3 and I2=I4)
#### I3/I4 = R2/R1 ------------------ (1)

Similarly,
#### -I3R3 + IG + I4R4 = 0
#### -I3R3 + 0 + I4R4 = 0 (IG = 0)
#### -I3R3 + I4R4 = 0
#### I3R3 = I4R4
#### I1R3 = I2R4 (I1=I3 and I2=I4)
#### I1/I2 = R4/R3 ------------------ (2)
#### from equation (1) and equation (2)
#### we have conclude that,
#### R2/R1 = R4/R3
#### this is Wheatstone bridge balanced condition.
