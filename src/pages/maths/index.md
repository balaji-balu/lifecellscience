### Set Theory

 Introduction: A set is a collection of an object. We have to describe a sets concept by using geometrical diagram. A bag contains a well defined red color balls. Therefore a bag is Set and red color balls are a well defined elements.

 Now, a given set of objects we are in a position to distinguish those objects in the set from those that are not in the set. Such a set is said to be a well defined set. Object may be a man, a number, letter or anything. 
A set is said to be well defined if, given an object we can decide whether it is an element of the set or not. A set is represented by a capital letters of an English alphabet (A, B, C,……), similarly an elements represented by a small letters of an English alphabet (a, b, c, d,……..).
While writing the set A consisting of elements a, a, b, b, c, c, d, d we do not repeat the elements which occur more than one time. 
The set of letters given above is indicated by A = {a, b, c, d}

### Structure of Set or Roster form:
To denote a set with finitely many elements, we can list all the elements of the set and enclose them by braces.
A = {1, 2, 3} in the set which has exactly three elements. 
A set of Natural numbers. N = {1, 2, 3, ………………………}
A set of Whole numbers. W = {0, 1, 2, ……………………...}
A set of Integer numbers. Z = {……-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, …….}

### Set builder form or Rule form:
We shall find it more convenient to describe a set by some property common to all its elements. A is a set of all even natural numbers. We can denote this set by an arbitrary letter say x and it represents every element of that set and we write. 
A = {2, 4, 6, ………………… }                                            A = { x : x is an even natural number}
B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11},                                              B = {x : x is a set of prime numbers less than 13}
C = {a, e, i, o, u},                                               C = {x : x is a vowel in English alphabet}
The letter x denotes any arbitrary element that belong to the set. The colon stands for “such that”. The colon follows the characteristic property that distinguishes x.
 	The notation x ∈ A means x is an element of A (x ∈ A we may say “ x belongs to A” or “A contains x”.) x ∉ A means x is not an element of A (x ∉ A we may say “x does not belongs to A “ or “A does not contains x”)   A = {1, 3, 5, 7}
                    1 ∈ A, 3 ∈ A, 5 ∈ A but 2 ∉{ 1, 3, 6}



### Trignometry

#### Define ratios in a right ange triangle 

Consider a right angle triangle ABC having right angle at B as shown in the following figure. Then, trigonometric rations of the angle A in right angle triangle ABC are defined as follows 

![Figure 1](/img/trig-0.png)

$\sin of \angle A = \sin A$ = length of the side opposite to $\angle A$ / length of hypotaneous = $\dfrac {BC}{AC}$

$\cos of \angle A = \cos A$ = length of the side adjacent to $\angle A$ / length of hypotaneous = $\dfrac {AB}{AC}$

$\tan of \angle A$ = Length of the side opposite to $\angle A$ / Length of the side adjacent to $\angle A$ = $\dfrac {BC}{AB}$

**Problem 1:** Find (i) $\sin C$ (ii) $\cos C$ and (iii) $\tan C$ in the triangle.

![Figure 2](/img/trig-1.png)

_Solution:_
Using Pythagoras theorem
$$
\begin{gathered}
(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 \\
(13)^2 = (AB)^2 + (5)^2 \\
169  = (AB)^2 + 25 \\
(AB)^2 = (169-25) \\
(AB)^2 = 144 \\
AB = \sqrt144 \\
AB = 144 \\
AB = 12 cm \\ \\
\sin C= \dfrac{AB}{AC}  = \dfrac{BC}{AC} \\
\tan C = \dfrac{AB}{BC} \\
\sin C= \dfrac{12}{13} \\
\cos C= \dfrac{5}{13} \\
\tan C = \dfrac{12}{5} \\
\end{gathered}
$$

**Problem 2:** 
In a triangle XYZ, ∠Y is right angle, XZ = 17cm and YZ = 15cm, then Find $(i) \sin X (ii) \cos Z (iii) \tan X$ in the triangle

![Figure 3](/img/trig-2.png)

_Solution:_
using Pythagoras theorem,

$$
\begin{gathered}
 (XZ)^2 = (XY)^2 + (YZ)^2 \\
(17)^2 = (XY)^2 + (15)^2 \\
(289)  = (XY)^2 + (225) \\
XY^2 = 289 - 225 \\
(XY)^2 = \sqrt64 \\
XY = 64 \\
XY = 8 cm \\ \\
\sin X= \dfrac{YZ}{XZ}  = \dfrac{YZ}{XZ} \\
\tan X = \dfrac{YX}{XZ} \\ \\
\sin X= \dfrac{15}{17} = \dfrac{15}{17} \\
\tan X = \dfrac{15}8 \\
\end{gathered}
$$

**Problem 3:** In a triangle PQR with right angle at Q, the value of ∠P is x, PQ = 7cm and QR = 24 cm, then find sin x and cos x.

![Figure 4](/img/trig-3.png)

_Solution:_

Using Pythagoras theorem,

$$
\begin{gathered}
  
 (PR)^2 = (PQ)^2 + (QR)^2 \\
(PR)^2 = (7)^2 + (24)^2 \\
(PR)^2 = 49 + 576  \\
(PR)^2 = 625 \\
PR = 625 \\
PR = 25 cm \\ \\
\sin X= \dfrac{PQ}{PR} = \dfrac {PQ}{PR}  \\     
\sin X= \dfrac{24}{25} = \dfrac {7}{25}    
\end{gathered}
$$

**Problem 4:**
In a right angle triangle ABC, Right angle is at C. BC + CA = 23 cm and BC - CA = 7 cm, then find sin A and Tan B 

_Solution:_

Given equation 

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
BC + CA = 23 cm  ====> 1\\
BC  - CA  = 7  cm =====>2
\end{alignedat}
$$
Adding equation (1) and equation (2)
$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
  BC + CA = 23cm \\
+\qquad BC - CA = 07cm \\
==========\\
2BC  = 30 cm
\end{alignedat}
$$

$BC = \dfrac {30}{2} cm$

$BC = 15 cm$ 

By applying BC value in equation (1) we get 

$BC + CA = 23 cm$

$15 + CA = 23 cm$

$CA = 23 cm - 15 cm$

$CA = 8 cm$


_Verification:_

$BC + CA = 23 cm$

$15 cm + 8 cm = 23 cm$

$23 cm = 23 cm$

##Exercises 

**Exercise 1:** If tan A = 34, then find the other trigonometric ratio of $\angle A$

![Figure 5](/img/trig-4.png)

_Solution:_

Hence $\tan A$ = Opposite side / Adjacent side = $ \dfrac {3}{4} $

Therefore, opposite side: adjacent side = 3: 4

For angle A, Opposite side = BC = 3k

Adjacent side = AB = 4k (Where k is any positive number)

Now, we have in $\triangle$ ABC (by Pythagoras theorem)

<!-- $$
(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 \\
(AC)^2 = (3k)^2 + (4k)^2
(AC)^2 = 9k^2 + 16k^2
(AC)^2 = 25k^2 \\
AC = \sqrt25k^2
$$ -->
$(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2$

$(AC)^2 = (3k)^2 + (4k)^2$

$(AC)^2 = 9k^2 + 16k^2$

$(AC)^2 = 25k^2$

$AC = \sqrt 25k^2$

$AC = 5k$ hypotenuse

Now, we can easily write the other ratios of trigonometry

$\sin A = \dfrac{3k}{5k} = \dfrac{3}{5}$ and $\cos A = \dfrac{4k}{5k} = \dfrac{4}{5}$

**Example 2:**  In $\triangle$ ABC and $\triangle$ PQR, if $\angle A$ and $\angle P$ are acute angles such that $\sin A = \sin P$ then prove that $\angle A=\angle P$.

![Figure 6](/img/trig-5.png)

_Solution:_

Given $\sin A = \sin P$

We have $\sin A = \dfrac {BC}{AC}$  and $\sin P = \dfrac{QR}{PQ}$

Then $\dfrac{BC}{AC} = \dfrac{QR}{PQ}$

Let $\dfrac{BC}{AC} = \dfrac{QR}{PQ} = k$ ------------------------------ (1)

By using Pythagoras theorem

$$
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 and PQ^2 = PR^2 + QR^2
$$

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 - BC^2 and PR^2 = PQ^2 - QR^2
$$

$$
AB = AC^2 - BC^2  and PR = PQ^2 - QR^2
$$

$$
AB = AC^2 - BC^2  and PR = PQ^2 - QR^2
$$
